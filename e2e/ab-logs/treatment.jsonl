This study evaluates the utility of FES-PET/CT compared to standard-of-care (SOC) imaging for staging ER+ ILC. This IRB-approved prospective trial (October 2022-October 2024) enrolled adults with histologically confirmed ER+ ILC at a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Participants underwent FES-PET/CT, with optional [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT. The primary endpoint was the percentage of stage changes post-FES-PET/CT compared to SOC imaging, analyzed using a 1-sided binomial proportions test. Imaging was interpreted by a blinded nuclear and breast radiology specialist, with staging per AJCC eighth edition guidelines. Of 27 enrolled participants, 25 underwent FES-PET/CT (2 excluded due to synthesis failure). Mean age was 60.3 years. Pre-FES-PET/CT staging was stage I (16%), II (60%), III (20%), and IV (4%). FES-PET/CT altered clinical staging in 32% of cases (P = .036), identifying occult stage IV disease in 12.5% and histologically confirmed axillary lymph node metastases in 8%. However, it missed axillary metastases in 28% compared to surgical staging.
