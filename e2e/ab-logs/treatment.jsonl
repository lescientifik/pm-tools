The primary endpoint was the percentage of stage changes post-FES-PET/CT compared to SOC imaging, analyzed using a 1-sided binomial proportions test. Imaging was interpreted by a blinded nuclear and breast radiology specialist, with staging per AJCC eighth edition guidelines. Of 27 enrolled participants, 25 underwent FES-PET/CT (2 excluded due to synthesis failure). Mean age was 60.3 years. Pre-FES-PET/CT staging was stage I (16%), II (60%), III (20%), and IV (4%). FES-PET/CT altered clinical staging in 32% of cases (P = .036), identifying occult stage IV disease in 12.5% and histologically confirmed axillary lymph node metastases in 8%.

The RF model stratified patients into low- (median OS not reached), intermediate-(11.8 months), and high-risk (9.55 months) groups (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Baseline 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT-derived volumetric parameters (wbPSMA-TV and wbTL-PSMA) serve as independent prognostic biomarkers for survival in mCRPC patients receiving ARPI therapy. Integration of these metrics with clinical variables enhances risk stratification, potentially guiding personalized therapeutic strategies.

In a dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced rat model of PCOS, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of SZ-A and its underlying microbiota-metabolite interactions through integrated assessments of reproductive and endocrine-metabolic function, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and gut microbiota and serum metabolite profiles. Relative to SD rats, PCOS rats showed approximately 10-fold higher cystic follicle burden and a one-third reduction in corpora lutea, with serum testosterone rising from 0.12 \u00b1 0.08 to 0.27 \u00b1 0.08\u00a0ng/mL, total bile acids falling from 34.22 \u00b1 5.52 to 20.63 \u00b1 4.94 \u03bcM, and HOMA-IR significantly increased (all p < 0.05). SZ-A treatment reduced cystic follicles, restored estrous cyclicity and luteal formation, and shifted testosterone, total bile acids, and HOMA-IR toward SD levels. At the molecular level, SZ-A appears to act by remodeling gut microbiota composition and serum metabolite profiles. SZ-A significantly shifted microbial \u03b2-diversity in PCOS rats while retaining a community dominated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes with Lactobacillus and Treponema_2 as key genera. Untargeted metabolomics identified 13 PCOS-associated serum metabolites that were significantly reduced after SZ-A trea", "stderr": "", "elapsed_s": 0.281, "ts": 1771590846.98055}

This study retrospectively included 298 patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer who underwent baseline dual-tracer PET imaging. Quantitative PET parameters for both [18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 were extracted. Clinical outcomes, including progression-free survival, biochemical response, and radiographic response, were collected during follow-up. Lesion-based analysis was performed in 267 measurable lesions to evaluate the association between tracer uptake and local radiographic response, as determined by changes in lesion diameter following systemic therapy. Here we show that higher whole-body [18F]FDG uptake, including total lesion glycolysis (HR\u2009=\u20093.525, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and metabolic tumor volume (HR\u2009=\u20092.757, p\u2009<\u20090.001), is significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival. In contrast, only PSMA-derived tumor volume (HR\u2009=\u20092.019, p\u2009=\u20090.018), but not total lesion PSMA uptake (HR\u2009=\u20091.438, p\u2009=\u20090.221), demonstrates prognostic value. Moreover, patients with higher whole-body [18F]FDG burden receive greater benefit from chemotherapy (HR\u2009=\u20092.936, p\u2009=\u20090.004). At the lesion level, higher [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake is significantly correlated with more favorable radiographic response (p\u2009<\u20090.001), while lesion-level [18F]FDG uptake does not demonstrate predictive value.
