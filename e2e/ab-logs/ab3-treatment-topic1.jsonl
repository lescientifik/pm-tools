Either 2-fluoro-17\u03b2-estradiol (2-FE2) or 4-fluoro-17\u03b2-estradiol (4-FE2) was administered subcutaneously for 52 weeks to August Copenhagen Irish (ACI) rats, the preferred animal model for human breast cancer. 4-FE2 induced frequent mammary tumors whereas 2-FE2 did not. The cumulative incidence of mammary tumors in rats treated with 4-FE2 was comparable to that observed with E2. The carcinogenic results were supported by histological examination of mammary glands of fluorinated estrogen-treated ACI rats. To evaluate the estrogenic potential of the fluorinated estrogens, 2-FE2 or 4-FE2 was administrated subcutaneously to ovariectomized rats. Both 4-FE2 and 2-FE2 showed high uterotrophic potency. Our results indicate that estrogenic potential may not be the sole factor driving mammary tumorigenesis. Since fluorination inhibits metabolic hydroxylation of E2 at the substituted position, the carcinogenic effect may occur through the metabolic activation of 2-hydroxylated E2, in combination with the compound's estrogenic potency.\", \"doi\": \"10.1016/j.toxlet.2019.10.015\"}\n{\"pmid\": \"31732674\", \"title\": \"Recent Advances in Imaging Steroid Hormone Receptors in Breast Cancer.\", \"authors\": [\"Kumar Manoj\", \"Salem Kelley\", \"Tevaarwerk Amye J\", \"Strigel Roberta M\", \"Fowler Amy M\"], \"journal\": \"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine\", \"year\": \"2020\", \"date\": \"2020-02\", \"abstract\": \"Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) are important prognostic and predictive biomarkers in breast cancer.
