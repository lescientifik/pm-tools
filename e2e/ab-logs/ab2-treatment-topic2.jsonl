In a dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced rat model of PCOS, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of SZ-A and its underlying microbiota-metabolite interactions through integrated assessments of reproductive and endocrine-metabolic function, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and gut microbiota and serum metabolite profiles. Relative to SD rats, PCOS rats showed approximately 10-fold higher cystic follicle burden and a one-third reduction in corpora lutea, with serum testosterone rising from 0.12 \u00b1 0.08 to 0.27 \u00b1 0.08\u00a0ng/mL, total bile acids falling from 34.22 \u00b1 5.52 to 20.63 \u00b1 4.94 \u03bcM, and HOMA-IR significantly increased (all p < 0.05). SZ-A treatment reduced cystic follicles, restored estrous cyclicity and luteal formation, and shifted testosterone, total bile acids, and HOMA-IR toward SD levels. At the molecular level, SZ-A appears to act by remodeling gut microbiota composition and serum metabolite profiles. SZ-A significantly shifted microbial \u03b2-diversity in PCOS rats while retaining a community dominated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes with Lactobacillus and Treponema_2 as key genera.

Delivering optimal radiation dose to tumors while minimizing dose to organs-at-risk (OAR) remains an unmet need due to significant patient-to-patient heterogeneity in treatment response, necessitating multiple snapshots of the in vivo activity distribution. Towards this goal, here we present a high temporal-resolution activity reconstruction method demonstrated on preclinical prostate cancer models. Utilizing a priori knowledge of tumor locations from a pretherapy scan (e.g. PET/CT), we have developed a low-cost, sparse sensor network to reconstruct the real-time tumor and OAR activity in preclinical cancer models. The proposed system was successfully validated1 with a small custom phantom filled with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and (2) with 4 mice models, bearing varying numbers of tumors from two human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3-PIP, PC3-flu), to which [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 RPT was administered.

Eligible patients underwent PSMA PET/CT for restaging at first biochemical recurrence after RP, received sRT, and had \u226524 months of follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS), freedom from distant progression, and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for PFS were derived using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for age, pre-sRT prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and receipt of whole-pelvis radiotherapy (WPRT).
