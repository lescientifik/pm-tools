Quantitative PET parameters for both [18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 were extracted. Clinical outcomes, including progression-free survival, biochemical response, and radiographic response, were collected during follow-up. Lesion-based analysis was performed in 267 measurable lesions to evaluate the association between tracer uptake and local radiographic response, as determined by changes in lesion diameter following systemic therapy.
